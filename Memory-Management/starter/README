To complie:
	- Navigate to /starter
	- Type "make" on the command line


After the executable is generated, type "./main_test.out <a,b>" where 
	a = the algorithm, 0 stands for best fit and 1 stands for worst fit
	b = the test case number
		Case(1): Verify allocation and deallocation functions work
		Case(2): Verify best fit/worst fit find the correct chunk to allocate
		Case(3): Verify coalescence works in best fit/worst fit
		Case(4): Verify allocation function stops when the memory runs out
		Case(5): External fragmentation tests with random requested sizes
